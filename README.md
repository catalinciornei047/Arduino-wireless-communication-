wireless communication between a sensor GY-521 and a 20x4 LCD screen
The purpose of this project is to transmit the data obtained from the GY-521 sensor and displaying them using a 20x4 LCD screen on two columns, the first column being intended for display of the data obtained for the acceleration for the axes (x,y,z) and respectively for the second column the data obtained from the gyroscope. Data is transmitted and received through the modules NRF24L01+ communication. Two Arduino Nano V3 boards are also used for source code development. 
 When the sensor changes its position it will modify the values ​​obtained on both the serial monitor and the LCD screen.
